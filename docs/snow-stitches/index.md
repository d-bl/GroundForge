TO DO
=====

The page is still under construction.

* It should be possible to start some snowflakes with the two pairs on the right and others on the left. For now, we not complete the symmetry.
* The pair diagrams on the _pairs from thread_ page need a better user interface: the same interactive [color code](/GroundForge-help/color-rules) as the [stitches](../stitches) page.

The page is inspired by a ground first seen in a design by [Kumiko Nakazaki](https://www.librarything.com/work/27350193).
