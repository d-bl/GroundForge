three/six-pair connections
==========================

![sample](sample.png?align=left)
On the left a sample of lace by Babette.
She invented a double hexagonal ring pair around a snowflake.
This is a variation on snowflakes in a Paris ground.
The intersections of the double ring pairs are in fact compact snowflakes.

The pair diagram of a six pair snowflake can be interpreted
as a thread diagram of a three pair connection. 
Each three pair connection can be composed with a group of two pair stitches.
The form on this page starts with the last step to provide building blocks for a combination of four snowflakes. 
The [default](?) pattern reconstructs a double hexagonal ring pair with an arbitrary snowflake.

![](capture-extract.svg?align=right)
On the right the first repeat of the [default](?) template: 
four groups of stitches with three pairs, you can replace the groups one by one through the form.
The colors match the hexagons below and the thread diagram.
The pair diagram has a [color code] that caters for unorthodox stitches.

Click one of the hexagons to apply the stitches in the text field.
You can enter up to 10 stitches.
An odd number of stitches (minimal three) needs a [workaround].
Just a few recipes for the form [here](/MAE-gf/docs/snow-stitches/563412-145236.svg)
and [here](/MAE-gf/docs/misca#3-paired-join),
we suggest to create and collect your own [recipes](/MAE-gf/docs/snow-stitches/#pair-diagrams-interpreted-as-thread-diagrams-with-blobs).

When satisfied with the result, you can follow the link to the _pairs from threads_ page to assign stitches for the actual snowflakes.
Even without that last step it can be fun to play with configurations of snowflakes.

Links in a [saved PDF] may lead you back to the _stitches_ or _droste_ page. 
For patterns created by this page, you can replace that part in the address bar
with _snow_stitches_ to return to this page.
