TO DO
=====

The page is still under construction.

* Allow snowflakes to start with different pairs. Currently, all should start on the right or all on the left. For this reason _ne/sw_ does not complete the symmetry.
* The pair diagrams on the _pairs from thread_ page need a better user interface: the same interactive color code as the [stitches](../stitches) page.

The page is inspired by a ground first seen in a design by Kumiko Nakazaki.
