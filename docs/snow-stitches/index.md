title: snow with double ring pairs
---

So far, about a [template].

![sample](sample.png?align=left)  
We saw a double ring pair around snowflakes in a design by [Kumiko Nakazaki].
It is a variation of ground B4.1 in [Viele Gute Gründe] by Ulrike Volker-Löhr.
The corners of te ring pairs are in fact compact snowflakes.
Curiosity led to a method to generate all kinds of variations with GroundForge.

![pairs as threads for a snowflake](blobs.png?align=right)  
We can interpret pair diagrams of snowflakes as thread diagrams.
The figure on the right highlights four stitches in such a thread diagram.
The caption enumerates these stitches in the order they are worked.
The R means we start working with the two pairs on the right.
More examples (and explanations) on [MAE-gf](/MAE-gf/docs/snow-stitches/#examples).

![img.png](capture-of-double-ring-pair.png)  

The image above shows a reconstruction of a ground with a double ring pair.
See also the [color coding](/GroundForge-help/color-rules).
The star in the center of the hexagonal ring is yet another snowflake.
Below a fraction of this reconstruction. The pinkish dots represent snowflakes, each consisting of four blobs.
Most of the snowflakes start on the left, one on the right.

<input value="tc,rclcrc,clcrcl,ct" spellcheck="false">
flip:
<button>&harr;</button> 
<button>&varr;</button> 
<button>both</button> 
</form>

The form is not yet active. A click on a pink dot should assign the stitches for one snowflake.
For now, you have to assign the sixteen stitches manually to this [template].
Subsequently, follow the links to the _pairs from threads_ page to assign stitches for the actual snowflakes.
Even without that step it can be fun to play with configurations of snowflakes.

Another challenge is to support a mix of varying number of blobs and starting sides.
For that purpose we should be able to combine four of the following elements into a valid diagram.
