Pin distances and Angles
========================

[Brenda Paternoster] and [Martina Wolter-Kampmann] wrote references to estimate pin distances related to thread widths. The refrences are geared to traditional types of lace, you might need to adjust for your taste in experimental lace.

Groundforge generates patterns at a fixed grid size, so you will have to resize with an SVG editor. A grid in the background can help to resize your design to the desired pin distance. InkScape is an SVG editor that provides a tool to check distances and angles. Both are shown in the screen shot below.

To resize with a mouse, InkScape requires holding down the control-key while dragging a corner. Otherwise the angle changes.
