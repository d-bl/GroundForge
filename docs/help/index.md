Experiment with Bobbin Lace Grounds
-----------------------------------

This site is bobbin lace makers and designer who tend to use or write books like
"_The Book of Bobbin Lace Stitches_" by  Bridget Cook,
"_Viele gute Gründe_" by Ulrike Voelcker Löhr and 
"_Gründe mit System_" by Uta Ulrich.
Nothing to install, free of charge, free to contribute,
alter and redistribute provided some limitations by the GPL-v3 license
and possible copyrights on specific modern patterns.
It doesn't make these books redundant but can help to avoid 
tedious fruitless experiments making real patches of lace.

Vary stitches and reshape downloadable diagrams to get a myriad of variations on a single pattern.
Experiment and play around with the hundredths of provided patterns or add your own.
Even when reinventing wheels, your own discoveries can bring great joy. 

The [tiles](../tiles.html) page generates thread diagrams from pair diagrams. 
The first lines of text guide you through most important first steps.
Help pages in the side bar explain more in-depth subjects.
The following section discusses a versatile traditional pattern.

Add foot sides to a small strip of a (symmetrical or not?) pattern to get a braid.

Tutorial
--------
One [screencast](https://github.com/d-bl/GroundForge/releases/download/2019-Q2/catalogues.mp4)
(123 MB, 2:32 min) goes through various catalogues to variations of the same base pattern.
Use the pause button and slider to repeat, try for yourself get side tracked and have fun.

Another screencast (with script) walks through some important functions to make variation on these patterns,
but first an explanation of the objective of some of the shown actions.

### A versatile pattern &mdash; Change/drop stitches

The still diagrams show four variations out of [thousands](#nrs) of possibilities for a versatile pattern.
We have interactive diagrams definitions [with] or [without] foot sides, see also the notes on [patch sizes] for the latter.

Changing stitches requires the same procedure as dropping stitches the simple way.
To hit two birds with one stone we show the last.

Note the one (center) or two (top and bottom) grey symbols in three of the four upper diagrams.
These grey symbols represent stitches dropped the easy way:
by replacing `ctc` with `-` in the yellow pop-ups. 
This easy way can have unexpected results such as more stitches disappearing
and/or the algorithm switching pairs before making another stitch.
The latter effect causes weird thread diagrams.

### Drop stitches II (with the advanced section)

Another method to drop stitches uses the advanced section.
Apply the blue changes below for the second and last variant above.
Apply the red changes for the third variant.

### 2nd Screen cast

A [screencast](https://github.com/d-bl/GroundForge/releases/download/2019-Q2/BK-31.mp4) (35 MB) follows the script below,
applying what is explained above.

A lot happens in a short time, use the pause button and slider to repeat. 
Newbies may skip the bold steps when trying to understand/repeat the scenario.

* 0:00 start with this help page (a slightly older version is recorded)
* 0:00 follow "_with_"
* 0:05 drop center stitch: `ctc` -> `-`
* 0:10 ![wand](../images/wand.png) generate new diagrams
* **0:18** reload web page : restores original diagrams
* **0:19** scroll down to advanced section
* **0:22** drop center stitch: `353,153` -> `-5-,5-5-`
* **0:35** ![wand](../images/wand.png) : different prototype, same pair/thread diagram
* 0:41 follow (i)
* 0:44 follow "_stitches_"
* 0:45 copy edge stitch
* 0:49 previous browser tab
* 0:52 paste the copied stitch and edit into turning stitch.
       Note that ctc, twist one pair, ctc is a single stitch for GroundForge.
       It makes the runner changing direction, therefore: turning stitch. 
* 1:19 ![link](../images/link.png)
* 1:23 reload web page
* 1:26 current pattern is reloaded
* 1:27 create favourite
* 1:33 "_animate_" pair diagram
* 1:36 increase thread diagram container (alternative: ![](../images/size-inc.jpg) ![](../images/size-dec.jpg))
* 1:38 scroll down to get thread container back into view
* 1:42 toggle thread color when tooltip displays thread number
* 1:47

Acknowledgement / Number of variations
--------------------------------------

Feature 31 in the [DKV pattern] "Binche Kompakt" was previously published in "Kant" issue 2000/2.
Anne-Marie Verbeke-Billiet puts four variations (others than the variants discussed above)
of sometimes lost Binche grounds in historical context.

Nowhere a strong close up for the challenging ground.
That asked to define the generated thread diagrams discussed above.

The hard copy catalogue "_Viele gute Gründe_" by Ulricke Voelcker Löhr has 28 combinations
of stitches for the second variant (5,6,17-23,26-36,93,103,132,139,140 in the B3 series),
3 each for the two last variants (12-14, 106-108) and 7 for the first (25,71-76).
That adds up to 41. Multiplied with the first 22 of B4.2 (that surrounds the six-pair element)
gives 902 documented thread diagrams for this base pattern.

The stitch combinations for the second variant might be pretty complete
for symmetrical options and traditional stitches.
The first variant has more stitches than the second
so it must also allow more stitch combinations.
The third and last variant also must allow for more than three stitch combinations each.
Only sample 33 and 106 of B3 have unorthodox stitches that twist just one pair or none.
Making more use of these stitches or drop more stitches allows even more combinations.
All in all the number of possibilities may well run into the thousands.
