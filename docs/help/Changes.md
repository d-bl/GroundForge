Stay posted about past changes
------------------------------

Now and then visit the [release notes] which may be a little behind on the actual [changes]

Feeds can alert you about changes in the [project files] and [release notes].

The sources of the [help pages] (or any other file) have a `history` button and a `blame` button.
The latter shows who was the last to touch a line, might be just a space or typo.
