Changes
=======

Stay posted about past changes
------------------------------

Now and then visit the [release notes] which may be a little behind on the actual [changes]

Feeds can alert you about changes in the [project files] and [release notes][atom-notes].

The sources of the [help pages] (or any other file) have a `history` button and a `blame` button.
The latter shows who was the last to touch a line, might be just a space or typo.

Stay posted on discussions
--------------------------

To receive email alerts about discussions: use the "watch" button almost on top of the [project page].
