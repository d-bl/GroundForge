Tile layout
===========

The "Tile layout" panel controls the way a base pattern repeats.

| Buttons | | Steps (either 1+2 or 3) |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| ![](images/blue-tile.png) | &nbsp;**1**&nbsp;<br><br> | Choose the initial layout of the tiles. |
| ![](images/nudge-tiles.png) | **2**<br><br><br> | Fine tune the choice made above. <br> Each arrow nudges the green or purple tile (see the bottom of the video) one grid position. |
| ![](images/green-tile.png) <br> ![](images/purple-tile.png) | **3**<br><br><br><br> | Values resulting from the actions above. <br> You can also enter the values manually, see this [tutorial section](Advanced#glue-copies-together). <br> Some browsers might show a red border when the values are problematic. These problems might only show up with larger swatches as empty corners. |
| | | _A myriad of choices can render the same pattern, each has pros and cons._
| ![](images/brick-to-overlap-choices.png) | **?**<br><br><br> | Tutorial sections explain how to find a [simple](Advanced#simple-arrangement) tile (for example the 4x4) a [brick](Advanced#creating-a-smaller-base-tile) (the 2x4) or [overlap](Advanced#overlap-arrangement) (the 3x3, recorded in the video). Bigger tiles are also possible.

An example: corner-to-corner => overlap

The video above shows what happens with the diagram (and status bar of the browser)
when executing the steps numbered in the image below. 
The video starts with ground [F4](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/tiles?whiting=F4_P180&patchWidth=9&patchHeight=9&d1=ctc&c1=ctc&b1=ctc&a1=ctc&d2=ctc&c2=ctcllctc&a2=ctcrrctc&tile=1483,8-48&footsideStitch=ctctt&tileStitch=ctc&headsideStitch=ctctt&shiftColsSW=-2&shiftRowsSW=2&shiftColsSE=2&shiftRowsSE=2)
