Change the tiling of a pattern definition
=========================================

Patterns can have different types and sizes of tiles, each having their pros and cons.
This page shows the proces of changing the tile definition.

See also [tutorial](Advanced#glue-copies-together) pages for related subjects.

An example pattern
------------------

The image below shows the definition of ground

The faint stitches repeat the bright ones. The green rectangles show that the repetition has a brick style.
The small purple tile looks more like a unit presented in traditional text books.
The large purple tile allows you to vary stitches in two units of work. 

A procedure
-----------

The small purple tile requires the most steps. An animation shows the steps below.
The <a href="images/brick-to-overlap-animation.gif" target="_blank">animation</a>
appears in a new tab or window, reload that page to restart.

* Type the characters in the rectangle of your choice in the second text field.
* Select the alternating tiles.
* Move the purple tile until you have proper diagonals.
* Then move the green tile to get the diagonals together.
* Any textbook will explain the bottom corners of the unit are the top corners for the next row.
  We saw this happen when moving the tiles in place.
  Make these stitches faint with a dash.
  Having these stitches up to now might help to check the tiles arrived at their target: they blend. 

Subsequently, you will have to adjust what stitches to make at each position to get the original thread diagram.
Use two browser windows, one with the old pattern, one with the new pattern.
Then you can copy-paste the corresponding stitches.
