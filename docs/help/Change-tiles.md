Change the tile layout
======================

The "Tile layout" panel has visual controls to define the way a custom base pattern repeats.

| Buttons | | Steps (either 1+2 or 3) |
|:---:|---|:---|
| ![](images/blue-tile.png) | 1 | Choose the initial layout of the tiles. |
| ![](images/nudge-tiles.png) | 2 | Fine tune the choice made above. <br> Each arrow nudges the green or purple tile one grid position. |
| ![](images/green-tile.png) <br> ![](images/purple-tile.png) | 3 | Values resulting from the actions above though you can override manually. <br> The values are the positions of the green/purple tiles relative to the blue tile. <br> Some browsers might show a red border when the values are problematic. These problems might only show up with larger swatches as empty corners. |

The video above shows what happens with the diagram (and status bar of the browser)
when executing the steps numbered in the image below. 
The video starts with ground [F4](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/tiles?whiting=F4_P180&patchWidth=9&patchHeight=9&d1=ctc&c1=ctc&b1=ctc&a1=ctc&d2=ctc&c2=ctcllctc&a2=ctcrrctc&tile=1483,8-48&footsideStitch=ctctt&tileStitch=ctc&headsideStitch=ctctt&shiftColsSW=-2&shiftRowsSW=2&shiftColsSE=2&shiftRowsSE=2)

The very last action (not numbered) would bring you back to this page.

|:---:|---|
| ![](images/brick-to-overlap-start.png) | Step 1 of the video starts with typing the characters in the 3x3 rectangle. <br> A myriad of choices can render the same pattern, each has pros and cons. |
| ![](images/brick-to-overlap-choices.png) | Tutorial sections explain how to find a [simple](Advanced#simple-arrangement) tile (for example the 4x4) a [brick](Advanced#creating-a-smaller-base-tile) (the 2x4) or [overlap](Advanced#overlap-arrangement) (the 3x3, recorded in the video).
