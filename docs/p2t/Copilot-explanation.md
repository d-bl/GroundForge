This file, **svgPairsToThreads.js**, defines a JavaScript object `GF_svgP2T` that provides a set of functions for converting lace stitch sequences into SVG diagrams, specifically for visualizing bobbin lace threads and their interactions.

### High-Level Purpose

- **Bobbin lace patterns** involve threads that twist and cross in specific ways (notated as "c", "t", "l", "r" for cross, twist, left twist, right twist).
- This script takes a stitch notation (like "ctc" or "ctr") and generates an SVG diagram showing how threads should be positioned and interact, visualizing both the overall pattern and the individual thread paths.
- The code also supports uploading SVG templates and creates composite diagrams from them.

### Main Functionalities

#### 1. SVG Generation

- **`newSVG(w, h)`**
    - Creates a new SVG element with given width and height.

- **`newStitch(stitchInputValue, firstKissingPathNr, firstNodeNr, svgContainer)`**
    - Core function: parses a stitch notation string (e.g., "ctc", "ctlr") and draws the corresponding thread paths as SVG lines and curves.
    - Handles drawing nodes (circles), edges (lines/paths), and merges nodes for twists/crosses.
    - Converts lines to curved paths for twists/crosses and assigns thread numbers via CSS classes.
    - Returns the last node number used.

- **`drawLine`, `drawCircle`, `mergeNodes`**
    - Internal helpers for the above, handling SVG primitives and merging logic.

#### 2. Legend and Color Coding

- **`newLegendStitch(stitchInputValue, colorCodeElement)`**
    - Creates a visual legend for a stitch type, combining a mini SVG of the stitch and a color code representation.

#### 3. Thread Path Analysis

- **`addThreadClasses(svg)`**
    - Analyzes the SVG paths to assign consistent thread numbers to each path section (so you can visually track individual threads across the diagram).

#### 4. Working with Uploaded SVGs

- **`appendUploadedSvg(svgInput)`**
    - Takes an uploaded SVG (e.g., a lace pattern) and integrates it into the diagram, scaling and preparing it for further manipulation.
    - Calls `newLegendStitch` for each legend entry found in the SVG.

- **`createDiagram(templateElement, w, h)`**
    - Assembles a composite diagram from the SVG template, positioning and cloning SVG groups as needed to build the full pattern.

#### 5. File and UI Integration

- **`loadSVGFile(event)`**
    - Handles reading and sanitizing an uploaded SVG file, then passes it to `appendUploadedSvg`.

- **`init()`**
    - Sets up the file upload event listener and loads a default demo SVG for quick testing.

### How It Works: Example Scenario

Suppose you want to visualize a "ctc" stitch:
1. `newStitch("ctc", 0, 0, svgElement)` is called.
2. The string "ctc" is parsed:
    - Draws 4 vertical "paths" (columns) with nodes.
    - For each character:
        - "c" merges two nodes as a cross.
        - "t" would merge as a twist, etc.
3. After all merges and cleanups, the function replaces straight lines with paths, adding bends for twists/crosses.
4. `addThreadClasses` labels each path segment with a thread number, so you can track threads visually.
5. The SVG is now a visual, color-coded representation of the stitch.

### Key Points

- **Modular**: Functions are organized around SVG creation, stitch parsing, and thread analysis.
- **Domain-specific**: Tailored for bobbin lace diagrams, with knowledge of how threads interact and are notated.
- **Interactive**: Supports file uploads and dynamic diagram generation.

### In Summary

This script translates lace stitch instructions into detailed, interactive SVG diagrams, helping lace makers visualize and verify thread movements and pattern structure. It automates much of what would otherwise be careful manual drawing and thread tracking for bobbin lace design.
