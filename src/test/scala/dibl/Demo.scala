      The first pair diagram has positions initialised using the matrix cells as coordinates.
      These values are an estimate to prevent flipped and rotated diagrams when nudged by a force simulation.
      A thread diagram is created from a pair diagram by replacing each node with a couple of new nodes.
      These new nodes are all placed on the spot of their original node and are also nudged by a force simulation.
      A subsequent transition from a thread diagram to a pair diagram only restyles the nodes,
      their positions don't need nudging to optimise the next step.
